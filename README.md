# Games

This code appears to be an implementation of the classic game Pong using the Turtle library in Python. It sets up the game components (screen, ball, left and right paddles), listens for keyboard events to move the paddles, and updates the score of the game. The score is updated by checking which player (left or right) scored a point and incrementing the corresponding score by either 1 or 3. The score is then displayed on the screen using the write method of the Turtle object.
